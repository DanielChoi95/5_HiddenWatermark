Project 2 Hidden Watermark Encoder and Decoder Python Desktop App
You will build a python desktop application that will allow the user to encode a secret watermark inside their image. 
The method of this type of encryption is called Steganography.

Example use case: On Friday a company releases secret images of their new products to ten clients. 
The company encodes a different hidden watermark on the image sent to each client. 
The clients are not allowed to share these images since the information is still not public. 
On Monday the image of the new product went public online. 
You are able to decode the watermark and determine which client illegally released the images. 
Clients are not able to decode the watermark themselves since they do not have a secret encoding algorithm, 
and they are not able to see it and know the image was encoded.

Your desktop application should take an image and a logo then return an image with the logo secretly hidden in the original image. 
Your application should also be able to take an image and decode the hidden watermark by making it visible. 
The watermark should repeat itself many times on the image in case it is cropped or cut.

You will use Python as the language to build this application. 
Python comes with several frameworks for building desktop applications. 
While PySimpleGUI is a user-friendly Python framework, PyQt5 is one of the advanced Python-based GUI frameworks. 
For the encoding algorithms here is an example of a guy making the encoder and decoder on youtube. 
You can google yourself and find a better algorithm if you choose. Make sure you write units tests for this application.
